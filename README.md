# Display Modbus-Sensor Reading
Python script which displays the readings of the Sensor with GUI

-------------------------------------------------------------
Different versions of the project are uploaded like without GUI, with GUI(bars, graph, meters), real-time readings etc.
Files are named according to the their versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Install relevant libraries first to run the script.
I did it in my virtual environment.
Change the information like serial address etc of the sensor with the given information.
